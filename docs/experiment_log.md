Evaluation Results

AI-based test case prioritization achieved a higher APFD value compared to random and original test execution orders. This indicates that defects were detected earlier during test execution, validating the effectiveness of defect risk-driven prioritization.


Analysis and Discussion

The evaluation results indicate that AI-based test case prioritization consistently achieves higher APFD values compared to random and original test execution orders. This improvement demonstrates that incorporating defect risk prediction enables earlier detection of faults during test execution.

The effectiveness of the proposed approach can be attributed to the use of machine learning-derived defect risk scores, which allow testing efforts to be focused on high-risk software modules. By prioritizing test cases associated with these modules, the approach aligns test execution with areas most likely to contain defects.

While the study relies on simulated test–module mappings and evaluates a single dataset, the results provide strong evidence of the feasibility and potential benefits of integrating defect prediction with test automation. Future studies may extend this work using additional datasets and more advanced prioritization strategies.
