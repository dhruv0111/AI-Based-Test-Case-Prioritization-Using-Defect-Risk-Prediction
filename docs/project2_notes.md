Dataset and Test Case Mapping

The CM1 dataset provides module-level static code metrics but does not include test case coverage information. To evaluate test case prioritization, a simulated test–module mapping is constructed.

Each test case is assumed to cover one or more software modules. This simulation follows common practices in software testing research where real test coverage data is unavailable. The mapping enables evaluation of prioritization strategies while maintaining realistic testing assumptions.
